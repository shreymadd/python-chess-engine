                        CHESS ENGINE - HOW TO PLAY GUIDE
================================================================================

WELCOME TO THE PYTHON CHESS ENGINE!
====================================

This guide will teach you everything you need to know to play chess against our AI engine.

BASIC SETUP
===========
- You play as White (moves first)
- The AI plays as Black (responds to your moves)
- The game uses standard chess rules
- Enter moves in UCI (Universal Chess Interface) notation

CHESS NOTATION - UCI FORMAT
============================

UCI notation uses the format: [from_square][to_square][promotion]

Examples:
- e2e4    = Move piece from e2 to e4 (King's pawn opening)
- g1f3    = Move knight from g1 to f3
- e7e8q   = Move pawn from e7 to e8 and promote to Queen
- e1g1    = Castle kingside (king moves from e1 to g1)
- e1c1    = Castle queenside (king moves from e1 to c1)

BOARD COORDINATES
=================

Files (columns): a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h (left to right)
Ranks (rows):    1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (bottom to top for White)

   a b c d e f g h
 8 r n b q k b n r  8
 7 p p p p p p p p  7
 6 . . . . . . . .  6
 5 . . . . . . . .  5
 4 . . . . . . . .  4
 3 . . . . . . . .  3
 2 P P P P P P P P  2
 1 R N B Q K B N R  1
   a b c d e f g h

PIECE SYMBOLS
=============
K/k = King    (most important piece)
Q/q = Queen   (most powerful piece)
R/r = Rook    (castle piece)
B/b = Bishop  (diagonal mover)
N/n = Knight  (L-shaped mover)
P/p = Pawn    (foot soldier)

Uppercase = White pieces
Lowercase = Black pieces

BASIC CHESS RULES
=================

1. OBJECTIVE: Checkmate the opponent's king

2. PIECE MOVEMENTS:
   - Pawn: Forward one square (two on first move), captures diagonally
   - Rook: Horizontally or vertically any distance
   - Bishop: Diagonally any distance
   - Queen: Combines rook and bishop movement
   - Knight: L-shape (2+1 squares in any direction)
   - King: One square in any direction

3. SPECIAL MOVES:
   - Castling: King and rook move together (kingside: e1g1, queenside: e1c1)
   - En passant: Special pawn capture
   - Promotion: Pawn reaching end promotes to Queen, Rook, Bishop, or Knight

4. GAME ENDINGS:
   - Checkmate: King is attacked and cannot escape (you win/lose)
   - Stalemate: No legal moves but king not in check (draw)
   - Insufficient material: Not enough pieces to checkmate (draw)
   - Threefold repetition: Same position occurs 3 times (draw)

PLAYING THE GAME
================

1. Start the game by running: python main.py
2. The board will be displayed with coordinates
3. Enter your move when prompted (e.g., "e2e4")
4. The AI will think and respond with its move
5. Continue until the game ends
6. Type "quit" at any time to exit

COMMON OPENING MOVES
====================

Good first moves for White:
- e2e4  (King's Pawn - controls center, opens lines)
- d2d4  (Queen's Pawn - controls center, solid)
- g1f3  (King's Knight - develops piece, controls center)
- c2c4  (English Opening - flexible, controls d5)

TIPS FOR BETTER PLAY
====================

1. OPENING PRINCIPLES:
   - Control the center (e4, e5, d4, d5 squares)
   - Develop knights before bishops
   - Castle early for king safety
   - Don't move the same piece twice in opening

2. MIDDLE GAME:
   - Look for tactics (forks, pins, skewers)
   - Improve piece positions
   - Create threats and pressure
   - Control key squares and files

3. ENDGAME:
   - Activate your king
   - Push passed pawns
   - Centralize pieces
   - Learn basic checkmate patterns

UNDERSTANDING THE AI
====================

The AI uses:
- Material evaluation (piece values)
- Positional evaluation (piece placement)
- Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning
- Search depth of 3 moves ahead

The AI will:
- Try to win material (capture pieces)
- Improve piece positions
- Avoid losing pieces
- Look for tactical opportunities

TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

If you enter an illegal move:
- The game will show you it's illegal
- It may display some legal moves as examples
- Try again with a valid move

If you're stuck:
- Type "quit" to exit
- Restart with: python main.py
- Check this guide for notation help

EXAMPLE GAME START
==================

Game starts:
  a b c d e f g h
8|r n b q k b n r|8
7|p p p p p p p p|7
6|. . . . . . . .|6
5|. . . . . . . .|5

3|. . . . . . . .|3
2|P P P P P P P P|2
1|R N B Q K B N R|1
  a b c d e f g h

Your turn (White):
Enter your move: e2e4

You played: e2e4
AI is thinking...
AI plays: e7e5

And the game continues!

HAVE FUN AND GOOD LUCK!
========================

Remember: Chess is a game of patience, strategy, and learning from mistakes.
The more you play, the better you'll become!
